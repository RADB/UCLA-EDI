A formal assessment of language and cognitive skills is not intended.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rate the child as the child currently presents, NOT the way the child presented at the beginning of the school year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Responses should be based on an informal knowledge of the child’s skills based on observations in the last month.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Answer “yes” if the particular skill has already developed or is developing well. Answer “no” if the skill has not yet developed or is developing too slowly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Avoid the marking of “don’t know.” Answer ‘don’t know’ ONLY if you have not had the opportunity for observing/testing this particular skill or do not have the required information about the child. Where possible indicate the level (very good/good, average, poor/very poor) of ability or “yes” or “no” to indicate whether or not the child demonstrates the skill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" src="Images/image008.png" width="753" height="378" /></p>

</b></p>
<p>The focus is specifically on English language skills.  This question 
refers to the child’s use of appropriate words and expressions at appropriate 
times, as well as the child’s contribution to conversations.  Effective use 
is defined as use sufficient to convey the desired message.  Only basic 
grammatical concepts need to be adhered to, as long as the meaning is 
clear.  </p>

<p>Refers to the child’s ability to use verbal and, when necessary, non-verbal 
means (signs and gestures), to communicate what kind of assistance they may need 
in such a way that is understandable to the teacher and other children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Culture influences how children communicate with adults and peers.  Eye 
contact and speaking directly to an adult may be avoided as a sign of 
respect.  This is not to be confused with inappropriate means of 
communication, such as kicking and yelling.  This question is not meant as 
a measure of English language proficiency.</p>
