 <b>Social</b> refers to how individuals interact with others.  
<b>Emotional</b> refers to how individuals feel about themselves, others and the 
world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Base your answer to this question on how you view the child’s general ability 
to interact and relate appropriately to her/his peers, react to unexpected 
contexts, as well as their interest in the world around them.</p>

directly, does not interrupt when adults are talking or does it only 
occasionally, is polite when addressing adults.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-10" id="4-10"><b>10.  </b><b>demonstrates respect for other

<p> </p>
<p>Answer <b>NEVER OR NOT TRUE</b> if the child requires frequent 
redirecting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-14" id="4-14"><b>14.  </b><b>completes work on time</b></a></p>

the world</b></a></p>
<p>This may be demonstrated in a variety of ways: e.g. the child asks lots of 
questions, participates in discussions about a variety of topics. Demonstration 
of the skill should not be dependent on English proficiency. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="Text Box: General note for questions 19-21:&#xD;&#xA;The intent of questions 19-21 is about engaging with toys, games, and books that are not familiar to the child. The emphasis is on “new” rather than “eager.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Choose the option that best describes the frequency of the child’s choice to play with a new toy, game or book, when the toy, game or book appears in the classroom.&#xD;&#xA;" src="Images/image013.png" width="754" height="131" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-19" id="4-19"><b>19.  </b><b>is eager to play with a new toy</b></a></p>
<p>The child is eager to explore how unfamiliar objects, including toys, can be 
used as well as how they work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20.  </b><b>is eager to play a new game</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-21" id="4-21"><b>21.  </b><b>is eager to play with/read a new 
book</b></a></p>
<p>The child is quick to touch or look at unfamiliar books, or asks to play with 
and/or read new books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-22" id="4-22"><b>22.  </b><b>is able to solve day-to-day problems by 
him/herself</b></a></p>
<p>Refers to the child’s finding appropriate solutions (chooses an alternative, 
uses words to express his/her choices, finds a way to “fix” something) to 
day-to-day problems such as: when his/her selected area is “full,” a student 
chooses the book s/he had planned to view, when a pencil breaks, water gets 
spilled, etc. </p>
<p>Answer <b>NEVER OR NOT TRUE</b> if the child usually requires assistance from 
the teacher in such situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-23" id="4-23"><b>23.  </b><b>is able to follow one-step 
instructions</b></a></p>
<p>This has to be demonstrated by the child following one-step instructions with 
ease and without requiring frequent redirection or repetition of 
instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-24" id="4-24"><b>24.  </b><b>is able to follow class routines without 
reminders</b></a></p>
<p>Following class routines means that the child can successfully move between 
regular activities without individual prompting by the teacher. For instance, 
the child may know the group they are in for reading activities and move to that 
group instinctively at reading time, or know what they need to take with them to 
specialist classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>25.  </b><b>is able to adjust to changes in routines</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-26" id="4-26"><b>26.  </b><b><img alt="MCj04415050000[1]" src="Images/image006.png" width="24" height="24" /></b><b> answers questions 
showing knowledge about the world </b><b>(e.g., leaves fall in the autumn, apple 
is a fruit, dogs bark, etc.)</b></a></p>
<p>Knowledge of the world can include knowledge of the purpose of 
objects/animals (e.g. animals can be pets or food), knowledge of when events 
occur and knowledge of what objects do (e.g. boats float in water). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Questions can be answered through various means, including demonstration of 
knowledge and understanding through pointing, stories, drawings, play-acting, or 
modeling how things work or what things are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This question should not rely on English proficiency.  For Native 
American students, consider their specific knowledge, such as changes associated 
with the seasons.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-27" id="4-27"><b>27.  </b><b>shows tolerance to someone who made a 
mistake</b></a> (e.g., when a child gives a wrong answer to a question posed by 
the teacher)</p>
<p><img alt="Text Box: General note for questions 28-35:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the time the EDI is completed, most children will have been exposed to the situations below. Therefore, if they had not shown any of the described behaviors, the appropriate answer is NEVER OR NOT TRUE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have not had a chance to observe the child’s behavior, please choose DON’T KNOW or use your professional judgment to make a selection. Keep in mind that too many ‘don’t knows’ makes the questionnaire not scoreable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" src="Images/image014.png" width="754" height="188" /></p>
<p><a name="4-28" id="4-28"><b>28.  </b><b>will try to help someone who has been 
hurt</b></a></p>
<p>This also includes if the child seeks appropriate assistance from an 
adult.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>29.  </b><b>volunteers to help clear up a mess someone else has 
made</b></p>
<p> </p>

quarrel or dispute will try to stop it</b></a></p>
<p>This behavior is demonstrated by a child who reacts in ways that are 
appropriate to the context and that will help to resolve the conflict, even if 
he or she is not involved and does not know the people involved. For instance, 
this may include one or more of the following: the child seeking appropriate 
assistance from an adult; diverting the children involved to another activity; 
discouraging others from being involved; placing themselves physically between 
quarrelling children; and seeking other ways to diffuse the conflict.</p>
<p>Answer <b>NEVER OR NOT TRUE</b> if you have never seen the child assisting in 
a peaceful solution of a dispute.</p>
<p>Answer<b> DON’T KNOW </b>if you have never had a chance to observe the child 
in a context of a conflict between other children.</p>
<p><b>Please note:</b> It may be appropriate to enter<b> DON’T KNOW</b> if you 
think a child does not intervene or avoids intervening out of respect for the 
children involved or because that is the culturally appropriate behavior.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-31" id="4-31"><b>31.  </b><b>offers to help other children who have 
difficulty with a task</b></a></p>
<p>Refers to the child offering to assist when they notice their peers 
struggling or in response to a verbal or non-verbal request for assistance. 
Assistance is not imposed and is offered independently without encouragement 
from the teacher. The tasks do not have to be academic, (e.g., collecting a 
block from a high shelf in the classroom or assisting another child in a game in 
the playground).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Examples include: demonstrating the skill, sharing their work, or doing some 
of the task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Please note</b>: Children who are overly helpful or who offer help to 
please the teacher, should be rated high only if they are respectful of other 
children. “Taking over” or completing another child’s task without consideration 
of the other child should not be counted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-32" id="4-32"><b>32.  </b><b>comforts a child who is crying or 
upset</b></a></p>
<p>Examples may include a child who offers a toy/book etc. to a crying or upset 
peer; child who says “don’t cry,” “don’t be sad,” or reasons with the other 
child not to be upset; or suggests to the teacher ways for comforting the upset 
peer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-33" id="4-33"><b>33.  </b><b><img alt="MCj04415050000[1]" src="Images/image006.png" width="24" height="24" /></b><b> spontaneously helps 
to pick up objects, which another child has dropped </b><b>(e.g., pencils, 
books)</b></a></p>
<p>In this behavior, the emphasis is on spontaneity: the child reacts to as if 
it is a reflex, without prompting or expectation of a reward. Examples may 
include picking up sporting equipment, gloves, and pencils, with the intention 
of placing them in their right place or giving back to the owner. <b>Do not 
count </b>if the child claims the objects as his/her own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Please note: </b>Some children may not help because they do not perceive 
it as their place to touch another person’s belongings. In these instances, 
please select <b>DON’T KNOW</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-34" id="4-34"><b>34.  </b><b>will invite bystanders to join in a 
game</b></a></p>
<p>Probably best observed in unstructured games on the playground or during free 
play time in class. Examples involve a child who will call others to join a game 
already in progress (e.g., asks another child “Do you want to play with us?”). 
<b>Do not count </b>if a child invites another to start a game with him/her but 
will not allow others to join in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-35" id="4-35"><b>35.  </b><b>helps other children who are feeling 
sick</b></a></p>
<p>Also include if child seeks appropriate assistance from an adult.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-36" id="4-36"><b>36.  </b><b>is upset when left by 
parent/caregiver</b></a></p>
<p>If the teacher has no opportunity to observe the child’s behavior upon 
separation, choose <b>DON’T KNOW</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>37.  </b><b>gets into physical fights</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-38" id="4-38"><b>38.  </b><b>bullies or is mean to others</b></a></p>
<p>Bullying and being mean may take the form of physical, emotional or verbal 
manipulation. Rather than focusing on the intent or reasoning behind the 
actions, please report bullying in instances where the recipient of the actions 
feels they have been bullied.</p>
<p>Examples include: child makes negative remarks about others, intentionally 
excludes other children from activities, physically asserts themselves, makes 
unreasonable requests of peers knowing that they will oblige because they are 
scared or want to be included, or ignores children wanting their attention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-39" id="4-39"><b>39.  </b><b>kicks, bites, hits other children or 
adults</b></a></p>
<p>Child displays these actions either in or around the school. They actions may 
be unprovoked, provoked, or may occur as part of what a child considers ‘play,’ 
but are performed intentionally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40.  </b><b>takes things that do not belong to him/her</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-41" id="4-41"><b>41.  </b><b>laughs at other children’s 
discomfort</b></a></p>
<p>Please only report laughter that is either malicious, where the child appears 
to be deriving some pleasure from another’s discomfort, or laughter that draws 
negative attention to the other child.  Nervous laughter is distinct from 
this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-42" id="4-42"><b>42.  </b><b>can’t sit still, is restless</b></a></p>
<p>Child’s restlessness can be demonstrated by wandering around the classroom or 
yard, fidgeting with hands or feet or squirming in seat or fiddling with objects 
when the rest of the class is working, or looking around at other children when 
the class is listening to a story, or when the class is attending an event, like 
an assembly or a performance. <b>Do not</b> include if child becomes only 
occasionally restless when bored, tired, needs to use a toilet/washroom, or is 
excited waiting for special events, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-43" id="4-43"><b>43.  </b><b>is distractible, has trouble sticking to any 
activity</b></a></p>
<p>The emphasis for this question is on the word ‘any.’ Child has difficulty 
pursuing any activity for the necessary length of time, gets very easily/quickly 
distracted in an activity by anything happening around him/her, or finds other 
activities before completing the one started.</p>
<p>Distractible includes easily side-tracked.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>44.  </b><b>fidgets</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>45.  </b><b>is disobedient</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>46.  </b><b>has temper tantrums</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-47" id="4-47"><b>47.  </b><b>is impulsive, acts without 
thinking</b></a></p>
<p>Child acts in a way that may inconvenience or distract other children and 
this is not done intentionally. Child appears to act without considering others 
or the consequences and is not able to self-monitor their actions. Examples 
include blurting out answers before questions have been completed, starting a 
task or activity without hearing the full list of instructions, interrupting or 
intruding on others, unintentionally making upsetting comments, leaving the 
classroom without asking permission, calling out without raising a hand, running 
in the classroom, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-48" id="4-48"><b>48.  </b><b>has difficulty awaiting turn in games or 
groups</b></a></p>
<p>Examples include: child gets agitated if their needs/wants are not 
immediately met; tries to push in front of other children, calls out, butts in, 
takes over, or gets distracted and abandons games or group activities; child who 
always wants to be first in line or in receiving resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-49" id="4-49"><b>49.  </b><b>cannot settle for anything for more than a 
few moments</b></a></p>
<p>Child cannot engage in an activity (whether teacher-directed, self-chosen, or 
play), except for a very brief period.  For example, when given a task, 
child leaves seat in classroom, is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli, does 
not focus on task/activity, does not follow through to complete a task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-50" id="4-50"><b>50.  </b><b>is inattentive</b></a></p>
<p>Child fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes, 
has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities, does not seem 
to listen when spoken to directly, loses things necessary for tasks or 
activities (e.g., toys, assignments, pencils, books, or tools), does not follow 
through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork (<b>NOT </b>due to 
failure to understand instructions), daydreams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-51" id="4-51"><b>51.  </b><b>seems to be unhappy, sad or 
depressed</b></a></p>
<p>This is distinct from being tired though they may look similar. Children may 
appear withdrawn, be unenthusiastic and tend not to smile much. Depending on the 
child and frequency of the behavior, select <b>OFTEN OR VERY TRUE </b>or 
<b>SOMETIMES OR SOMEWHAT TRUE</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>52.  </b><b>appears fearful or anxious</b></p>
<p><b>53.  </b><b>appears worried</b></p>
<p><b>54.  </b><b>cries a lot</b></p>
<p><b>55.  </b><b>is nervous, high-strung or tense</b></p>
<p><a name="4-56" id="4-56"><b>56.  </b><b>is incapable of making decisions</b></a></p>
<p>Child takes an inappropriately long time to do one or more of the following: 
choose books to read/look at during silent reading; decide where to sit on the 
mat; and/or decide which color pencil to use. Child often waits for others to 
make a decision and mimics it, or requires adult direction or explicit 
instructions to make appropriate decisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-57" id="4-57"><b>57.  </b><b>is shy</b></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4-58" id="4-58"><b>58.  </b><b>sucks a thumb/finger or piece of 
clothing</b></a></p>
